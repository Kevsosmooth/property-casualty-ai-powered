CHAPTER TITLE: Insurance Terms and Related Concepts
Risk is uncertainty of loss.
Insurance is a transfer of risk from the insured to the insurer.
Pure risk means there is no chance of gain. Pure risk is insurable.
Speculative risk means there is a chance of a loss or a gain. Speculative risks are not insurable.
A hazard is something that increases the risk.
The principle of indemnity governs property and casualty policies. It states that the purpose of the policy is to restore the insured financially to where they were prior to their loss.
Insurable interest must exist on a casualty policy at time of loss in order for the policy to provide coverage.
The law of large numbers is used to predict the likelihood of loss.
Actual cash value is replacement cost minus depreciation.
Negligence is a tort, or a civil wrong; it is grounds for a lawsuit.
Negligence is the failure to act as a reasonable person would in the same set of circumstances.
An occurrence happens over a period of time.
A binder may be oral or written.
A binder provides coverage until the policy is issued.
A binder includes all coverages provided by the policy.
A warranty is a literal truth.
A representation is a substantial truth. In insurance, statements of the applicant/policyowner are representations – true to the best of their knowledge.
Concealment is an omission of a material fact.
The insurer has the right to sue a negligent third party for damages paid to an insured under the concept of subrogation.

CHAPTER TITLE: Provisions and Contract Law
Policy Structure:
The four parts of a policy may be remembered by the acronym D-I-C-E (declarations, insuring agreement, conditions, and exclusions).
The declarations list the named insured, policy limits, and premium and policy period.
The limits of liability are found on the declaration page of the policy.
The insuring agreement describes the coverages provided.
The conditions list the obligations of both parties, the insurer and the insured.
The exclusions list the perils that are not covered.
Provisions and Clauses:
If the insurer and insured disagree that the liability policy does or does not provide coverage, the claim will go to arbitration.
In arbitration there are three arbitrators.
The cancellation provisions are found in the conditions section of the policy.
The insured must promptly tell the insurer about a claim.
The other insurance clause is also known as the pro-rata liability clause.
Pro-rata does not mean equal, it is proportionate.
Federal Regulations:
The Fair Credit Reporting Act protects consumers against the circulation of inaccurate or obsolete personal or financial information.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that a customer be given out a privacy notice at the time the customer relationship is initially established and thereafter annually.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) applies to commercial policies only.

CHAPTER TITLE: Personal Lines - Dwelling Policy
The main difference between the various dwelling policy (DP) forms is the property perils insured against.
DP policies do not cover personal liability, although it can be added by adding an endorsement known as a Personal Liability Supplement for an additional premium charge.
DP policies contain general exclusions for damage due to war, nuclear hazard, and flood but not wind.
On a dwelling policy, other structures coverage will apply to a structure rented out as a private garage.
DP policies do not cover breakage of glass after 60 days of vacancy.
DP policies do not cover freezing of plumbing unless the heat was left on.
The land on which the insured dwelling sits is not insurable.
Inflation guard, also known as the automatic increase endorsement, must be added to a DP policy by endorsement.
A loss from rain or dust would only be covered if an opening in the dwelling roof or walls was first created by wind or another covered cause of loss.
When a dwelling is covered by more than one policy, losses are shared pro-rata under the other insurance clause. This may also be referred to as the pro-rata liability clause.
The Basic dwelling form DP-1 is a named or specified peril policy.
The DP-1 basic form does not provide additional living expense under coverage D; only fair rental value is provided.
The Extended Coverage Endorsement is added to the Standard Fire Policy to create the DP-1.
A DP-2 Broad Form policy is named perils on both the dwelling and the contents.
On the dwelling broad form DP-2 building structures (Coverages A and B) are written with an 80% coinsurance requirement.
On a DP-2 broad form, Coverage B (other structures) is in addition to other coverage limits.
The DP-3 policy will provide the same coverage as the DP-2 (contents broad) for personal property coverage, should coverage for contents be declared.
Although the DP-1 Basic Form does not provide coverage for trees, shrubs, plants and lawns, both the DP-2 and DP-3 do.
When a dwelling policy is referred to as DP-2 ('02), it is referring to the Dwelling Property Broad Form policy. The ('02) means it is the ISO policy form that was introduced in 2002.

CHAPTER TITLE: Personal Lines - Homeowners Policy
All HO policies are package policies combining property and liability coverages.
The most a policy will pay under the liability section is known as the limit of liability.
The definition of an insured includes residents of a household who are relatives, or any other person under age 21 who is in the insured's care.
All HO policies exclude coverage for flood, landslides or mudslides.
The homeowners policy does not cover theft of animals, birds or fish.
Personal injury liability for false arrest, libel, slander, defamation, and invasion of privacy is not automatically covered on an HO, but can be added by endorsement for an additional premium.
The land on which a house sits is not insurable on HO policies.
Section II (liability) provides additional coverage for damage to the property of others up to $1,000 per occurrence.
An HO policy will not cover the property of a boarder/renter, but will cover the property of a guest or residence employee.
An HO policy will provide coverage for contents anywhere in the world, including theft.
An HO policy written on a dwelling under the course of construction will not cover theft.
Medical coverage will cover charges for medical, surgical, x-ray, dental, ambulance, hospital, nursing, prosthetic devices and funeral services.
Medical payments never apply to regular members of the household.
The bankruptcy of an insured does not relieve the insurer of their obligations under the policy.
Claims resulting from the enforcement of an ordinance or law are not covered by most property policies, although limited coverage is provided as additional coverage.
The insurer's duty to defend a lawsuit is stated in the insuring agreement.
Additional coverages (such as for trees, shrubs and plants) are in addition to limits.
HO liability covers bodily injury to a third party.
If the insurer cancels an HO policy, they must send advance written notice to both the mortgage company and the named insured.
An HO policy will not pay the cost of defense on an excluded claim.
An HO policy covers contents in full while moving, for up to 30 days.
HO Coverage C will not cover property of a roomer, boarder or other tenant unless related to the insured.
Damage due to rain is not covered on a property policy unless the roof or wall was first damaged by wind or hail, allowing the rain to enter.
Property policies do not cover damage to motorized vehicles, other than those used to maintain the premises (e.g. riding lawn mowers).
Personal liability and medical coverage cover the insured's activities both on and off the premises.
Loss of use covers only additional living expenses.
The insurer's duty to defend a lawsuit ends when the amount paid out for damages equals the limit of liability.
A person who is hired to maintain a premises is referred to as a residence employee.
At the insured's option, recovered property will be returned to the insured or retained by the insurer. If returned, the loss payment must be adjusted.
After a loss, if the cost of reconstructing a home exceeds its market value, the insurer will consider it to be a constructive total loss.
HO-2 is named peril on both the dwelling and contents.
HO-3 is all-risk on a dwelling, but named peril on its contents.
In the HO-3 special form policy, theft of personal property of a resident employee is covered.
HO-4 are property policies issued to tenants to cover contents extend coverage to losses caused by a covered peril to improvements, alterations and additions made to the described location at the tenant's expense.
On HO-6 policy, contents coverage is named perils.
HO-6 (unit-owners form) does not cover common area buildings.
HO-8 was created specifically for older homes.

CHAPTER TITLE: New Jersey Insurance Regulations

1. Definitions
   Types of Insurers:
   A domestic insurer is one formed under the laws of this state.
   A domestic mutual insurer is owned by its policy holders, who elect the insurer's governing body or board of directors.
   A domestic mutual insurer has no capital stock.
   A foreign insurer is one formed under the laws of another state.
   An alien insurer is one formed under the laws of any other country other than the United States.
   A stock insurer is owned by its stock holders and issues nonparticipating policies, meaning that their policy holders do not participating in company profits in the form of dividends.
   A mutual insurer is owned by its policy holders and issues participating policies, meaning that their policy holders might receive dividends, although dividends may never be guaranteed.
   Producers:
   Producers may act as either brokers or consultants. No separate license is required.
   An insurance broker is a producer who represents the insured, or a producer who places insurance with an insurer who he does not represent as an agent.
   An insurance consultant is a producer who offers advice for a fee to the public or any licensee with respect to the benefits, advantages, or disadvantages of an insurance policy.
   A producer does not need to have a separate consultant's license in order to charge fees.
   Insurance consultants do not include bank trust officers, lawyers or CPAs.
   Fees charged by insurance consultants must be reasonable in view of the services performed.
   Persons may not sell, solicit or negotiate insurance unless they are properly licensed to do so.
   An insurance agent or producer is a person authorized, in writing, by an insurer to act as its agent to solicit, negotiate or sell insurance contracts on its behalf.
   Reinsurance and Retrocession:
   Reinsurance is a contract whereby the originating insurer (known as the ceding insurer) seeks to transfer all or part of their risk to an assuming insurer in an effort to reduce their risk exposure.
   Retrocession is the practice of one reinsurance company insuring another reinsurance company by accepting business that the other company had agreed to reinsure.
   An authorized insurer may not engage in extended reinsurance without the prior approval of the Commissioner.
   Certificate of Authority:
   A Certificate of Authority is granted to an insurer by the Commissioner authorizing or admitting the insurer to do business in this state. It is unlawful for an insurer to engage in insurance related conduct without a Certificate of Authority.
   An insurer doing business without a Certificate of Authority is known as an unauthorized or nonadmitted insurer.
   Selling insurance on behalf on an unauthorized insurer is a violation of the state Insurance Code.
   Insurance-Related Conduct:
   Insurance-related conduct is broadly defined to include selling, soliciting, negotiating or binding policies of insurance, as well as processing claims, communicating with insureds and collecting and transmitting premiums an insurer to engage in insurance related conduct without a Certificate of Authority.
   Anyone engaged in insurance related conduct comes under the jurisdiction of the state Insurance Code.
2. State Regulatory Jurisdiction
   Legislation:
   Insurance is regulated primarily by state law, not federal.
   The state Insurance Code is a body of laws (statutes) passed by the Legislature.
   In Paul vs. Virginia (1869), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that insurance was not commerce and was not subject to federal regulation under interstate commerce laws.
   In U.S. vs. South-Eastern Underwriters Association (1944), the Supreme Court reversed itself and ruled that insurance was a matter of interstate commerce and was subject to federal regulation.
   The McCarran-Ferguson Act (P.L. 15 of 1945), reaffirmed the right of the federal government to regulate insurance while declaring that it would not do so if the states did an adequate job.
   Department of Banking and Insurance:
   Broad Powers of Commissioner:
   The Commissioner of Banking and Insurance is appointed by the Governor, with the consent of the Senate.
   The Commissioner is the chief executive officer of the Department of Insurance.

   The Commissioner does not set the commission rates that insurers pay their agents.
   The Commissioner is responsible for making sure that insurers have adequate surplus (legal reserves) in order to pay claims.
   Notice of Hearing:
   The Commissioner has the power to conduct investigations, to administer oaths, and to interrogate licensees in connection with any investigation or hearing.
   Whenever the Commissioner believes that any person in the business of insurance is engaging in unfair or deceptive practices, he may issue a notice of a hearing.
   Such notice must be given at least 10 days prior to the time the hearing is scheduled.
   After a hearing, the Commissioner may place on probation, suspend, revoke or refuse to renew an insurance producer's license.
   Before imposing an administrative penalty, the Commissioner must send notice to the violator stating the alleged violation, a statement of facts regarding the violation, the penalties sought to be imposed and notice that the violator may request a hearing.
   If an alleged violator fails to respond to such notice, it shall be deemed to be an admission of all of the allegations contained in the notice.
   Penalties:
   After a hearing, the Commissioner may issue an order requiring such person to cease and desist from engaging in such practices. Persons who violate a cease and desist order may be fined up to $5,000 for each violation.
   Any person who violates the regulations regarding claims settlement practices may be penalized up to $1,000 for each violation, unless the person knew they were in violation, in which case the penalty may be up to $5,000 per violation.
   In addition to a cease and desist order, the Commissioner may order the payment of a penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, unless the person knew they were in violation, in which case the penalty may be up to $5,000 for each violation.
   In addition to, or in lieu of any other penalty, the Commissioner may impose a fine of up to $5,000 for the first violation and up to $10,000 for each subsequent violation.
   The Commissioner may also order restitution of monies owed any person and reimbursement of the costs of investigation and prosecution.
   A person whose application for an insurance license is denied by the Commissioner may appeal to the Office of Administrative Law.
   In addition, the Commissioner may request that the Attorney General bring criminal action under the applicable criminal statutes.
   If an alleged violator consents to an administrative penalty, the Commissioner may require that their license be returned for cancellation, the payment of a penalty and the reimbursement of the costs of the investigation and prosecution.
3. Licensing
   Types of Licenses:
   An insurance producer is defined as a person required to be licensed under the laws of this state in order to sell, solicit or negotiate insurance. The term includes insurance brokers, agents, consultants and general agents.
   Applicants for an individual resident producer's license must be at least 18 years of age.
   An individual who lives across the state line, but operates an insurance agency in this state, must have a New Jersey resident producer's license.
   A producer's license must contain the licensee's name, address, personal ID number, date of issuance, lines of authority and expiration date, but not their date of birth.
   Applicants must apply for their insurance license within 1 year of passing their state examination.
   Obtaining a limited license does not affect a producer's other insurance licenses.
   An insurance agent represents the insurance company, not the insured.
   To obtain a business entity producer's license, the entity must designate at least one individually licensed producer to be responsible for compliance with the insurance laws of this state.
   Nonresident producers may be licensed in this state without exam if they are currently licensed and in good standing in their home state.
   Nonresident licenses are based upon reciprocal agreements between states, which allow states to recognize each other's licenses.
   Nonresident producers who satisfy the CE requirements of their home state will be considered to have satisfied the New Jersey CE requirements.
   Prelicensing Requirements:
   Except for limited lines applicants, applicants for a resident producer license must complete the required prelicensing education requirements prior to taking the state exam.
   Although prelicensing education will be waived for license applicants who have a professional designation, such as CLU or CPCU, licensing examinations are not.
   Individuals who currently hold a resident producer license in another state or who have held such a license actively during the preceding 90 days are exempt from New Jersey prelicensing education and examination.
   Surplus Lines:
   Applicants for a Surplus Lines producer license must hold or will hold a property and casualty producer's license.
   Although applicants for a Surplus Lines license must pass a Surplus Lines exam, no surety bond is required as a condition to licensing.
   Other Producer Regulations:
   The Commissioner may issue a temporary work authority that is valid for up to 60 days, allowing a qualifying individual to transact insurance business while under the supervision of a currently licensed producer.
   Insurers contracting with a licensed producer must file a notice of agency contract (appointment) with the Commissioner within 15 days after entering into the contract or within 15 days after the first application is submitted by the producer.
   The Commissioner may issue a temporary producer's license without exam, for a period not to exceed 180 days, to the surviving spouse or personal representative of a producer who died, became disabled, or joined the U.S. Armed Forces.
   Maintenance and Duration of License:
   Failure to renew a license will result in an expired license.
   If a license has been expired for a period of less than one year, the applicant may apply for late renewal by paying late fees, completing required CE hours and certifying that they have not transacted any insurance business during the unlicensed period.
   Newly issued individual producer licenses will expire on the last day of the birth month of the producer in the year that will result in the term of license being at least 18 months. Thereafter, all such licenses expire every other year on the last day of the birth month.
   Except for limited lines producers, resident individual producers must complete 24 hours of continuing education (CE) during the previous license term, 3 of which must be related to professional ethics.
   CE courses must deal with insurance products, insurance practices, ethics, insurance fraud, insurance taxation, relevant state or national laws, claims or underwriting practices, or other topics directly related to the business of insurance, including professional designation courses for CLU & CPCU.
   Courses dealing with sales training, motivation or computer or business skills not specifically related to insurance will not be approved for continuing education credits.
   Property/casualty producers who write flood insurance must also complete 3 credit hours of CE related to the National Flood Insurance Program as part of their total CE obligation.
   License Refusal and Termination:
   When cancelling an agent's contract, the insurer must file a notice of cancellation with the Commissioner within 15 days.
   Submitting a license for cancellation does not terminate any disciplinary action against the licensee nor prevent disposition of any penalty or ordered restitution costs.
   If a producer's license is voluntarily terminated, they may reinstate it during the same renewal cycle by filing a new licensing application.
   A resident individual producer's license must remain in effect unless revoked or suspended as long as renewal fees are paid and continuing education requirements are satisfied.
   The Commissioner may suspend or revoke a producer's license for failing to comply with a court order imposing child support, the failure to pay income taxes or writing personal and controlled business.
   A producer's license is considered to be property of the state, and must be returned immediately to the Commissioner upon suspension or revocation.
   If a producer's license has been revoked, the former licensee may, after 5 years, apply for a license by submitting a new application, completing a prelicensing education course, passing the state examination and showing cause why reinstatement is warranted. The Commissioner may or may not grant reinstatement.
   If a producer's license has been suspended, the suspended licensee may reapply for a license by submitting a new application after the period of suspension has been completed, completing a prelicensing education course and passing the state examination.
4. Trade Practices
   Prohibited Practices:
   It is considered to be misrepresentation to misstate the future dividends to be received or the past dividends that were previously paid on a participating policy.
   It is prohibited to make any misrepresentation for the purpose of inducing a policy holder to lapse, forfeit, or surrender their policy, which is also known as twisting.

   It is unfair to discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin or ancestry.
   It is unfair to discriminate against any person on the basis of DNA or genetic screening.
   No producer may pay in connection with placing any policy, any valuable consideration or inducement, or any special favor in dividends not specified in the policy, which is known as rebating.
   The payment of dividends by a mutual insurer is not considered to be rebating since it is stated in the policy that dividends might be paid, although dividends are not guaranteed.
   Committing unfair claims settlement practices with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice constitutes a violation of the insurance code.
   No insurer may fail to fully disclose to first party claimants all pertinent benefits, coverages or other provisions of a policy under which a claim is presented.
   No producer may pay or return to any client all or any portion of the commission received in connection with the sale of insurance.

   Licensee Responsibilities:
   Business Names (Including Fictitious)
   Producers who solicit insurance are required to disclose their name as it appears on their license and the name of the insurer they represent prior to their solicitation.
   No producer may file a business name containing the words insurance company, or similar words unless the words agency or brokerage are used to distinguish the business from an insurer.
   Trade or fictitious business names may not be similar to the business name of another licensed producer and may not imply affiliation with any government entity.
   No producer may file a business name containing the words insurance company, or similar words unless the words agency or brokerage are used to distinguish the business from an insurer.

   Producers must maintain records of all trust account transactions for a period of 5 years after termination of coverage.
   Agents may not receive commissions unless they are properly licensed by the state.
   Agents may also be authorized to collect premiums and countersign insurance policies on behalf of the insurer they represent.
   Fraud:
   The purpose of the New Jersey Insurance Fraud Prevention Act is to facilitate the detection of insurance fraud, develop fraud prevention programs, require restitution of fraudulently obtained benefits and reduce the amount of premium dollars used to pay fraudulent claims.
   Whenever the Commissioner determines that a person has violated the Fraud Prevention Act, he may order restitution and levy a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for the first violation, $10,000 for the second violation and $15,000 for each subsequent violation.
   Information Privacy:

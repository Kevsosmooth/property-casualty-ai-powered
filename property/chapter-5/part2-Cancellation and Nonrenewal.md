Cancellation and Nonrenewal
Insurers may cancel a policy or coverage that has been in effect for less than 60 days at any time or for any reason.

After a policy has been in force for more than 60 days, an insurer may cancel a policy only for one of the following reasons:

Nonpayment of premium;
Moral hazard;
Material misrepresentation or nondisclosure to the company of a material fact at the time of acceptance of the risk;
Increased hazard or material change in the risk assumed which could not have been reasonably contemplated by the parties at the time of assumption of the risk;
Substantial breaches of contractual duties, conditions or warranties that materially affect the nature and/or insurability of the risk;
Lack of cooperation from the insured on loss control matters materially affecting insurability of the risk;
Fraudulent acts against the company by the insured or its representatives that materially affect the nature of the risk insured;
Loss of or reduction in available insurance capacity;
Material increase in exposure arising out of changes in statutory or case law subsequent to the issuance of the insurance contract or any subsequent renewal thereof;
Loss of or substantial changes in applicable reinsurance;
Failure by the insured to comply with any federal, state or local fire, health, safety, building or construction regulation, law or ordinance with respect to an insured risk which substantially increases any hazard insured against within 60 days of written notification of a violation of any such law, regulation or ordinance;
Failure by the insured to provide reasonable and necessary underwriting information to the company upon written request therefor and a reasonable opportunity to respond; and
Agency termination.
Notices of nonrenewal or cancellation must be sent no more than 120 days and no less than 30 days before the expiration date of the policy, unless the policy is being cancelled for nonpayment of premium. If being cancelled for nonpayment of premium, insurers must send notice at least 10 days before the effective cancellation date.

In regards to all commercial insurance policies (except workers compensation insurance and forgery bonds, ocean marine and aviation insurance and accident and health insurance and any policy written by a surplus lines insurer) and homeowners insurance policies, the following acts are prohibited:

Effecting or attempting to effect a mid-term premium increase and/or a reduction in the amount or type of coverage provided under the policy unless the Commissioner has given prior written approval.

Contains the reason(s) for the action; the name of all companies involved in the action; the line or class of insurance or the program affected; the number of policies and exposures for each line or class being nonrenewed or cancelled; the total market share of the nonrenewing or cancelling company or companies by line of insurance; a copy of the proposed notice; the criteria being utilized for the block action; a provision for a minimum of 60 days’ notice to be provided to the insured prior to the action; and the proposed duration of the block action plan.

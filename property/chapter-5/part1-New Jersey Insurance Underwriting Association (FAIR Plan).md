New Jersey Insurance Underwriting Association (FAIR Plan)

1. Purpose
   The New Jersey FAIR Plan was established to make essential property insurance available in urban areas to people who have an insurable interest in insurable property and have been unable to obtain property insurance in the voluntary market.

2. Creation of Association, Membership
   In order to operate the FAIR Plan, the New Jersey Insurance Underwriting Association was created. Membership in the association is mandatory for insurance companies authorized to write property insurance in New Jersey.

3. Application, Contents, Denial
   Any person with insurable interest in insurable property, who has failed to procure essential property insurance from an authorized insurer in the voluntary market, is entitled to apply to the Association for coverage and inspection of the property. Application may be made by any licensed producer authorized by the applicant. Each application must be made on a form prepared by the Commissioner and contain sufficient information to indicate evidence of failure to procure essential property insurance from an authorized insurer, whether the property is insurable, and whether or not there is any unpaid, uncontested premium due from the applicant for prior insurance on the property.

Limits
Insurable property for the purposes of the Plan means real property at fixed locations in urban areas in the same state, or tangible personal property located there, which does not have an insurable value in excess of $1,500,000.

Binding
It is not unusual for producers to place coverage in force before the insurer has an opportunity to issue the policy. This action is called binding coverage and can be verbal or in writing. A binder is an example of Express Authority. This temporary contract of insurance is valid for a short period of time.

A producer may issue a binder to provide coverage until the earliest of denial of the application, issuance of the policy, or 60 days.

Agent's Authority and Obligation
A producer assists the applicant in completing the application and submitting the application to the Association. However, there is no liability on the part of the Association for statements made in reports concerning the risk insured. Producers and employees of any participating insurance company may enter any land and premises to make necessary examinations, without being considered trespassers.

4. Rates
   Every insurer authorized to write property insurance in the state must collect a surcharge from the insured under any policy of basic property insurance. The amount of the surcharge is determined annually by the Commissioner and must be a reasonable amount which does not exceed 5% of the premium. This surcharge is paid over semiannually to the New Jersey Insurance Development Fund, which is a financial backup for the Association.

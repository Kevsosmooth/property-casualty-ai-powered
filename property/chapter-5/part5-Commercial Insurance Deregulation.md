Commercial Insurance Deregulation
Commercial Insurance Deregulation Act of 1982 was enacted to protect policyholders and the public against adverse effect of excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory rates. The purpose of the act was to:

Encourage independent action by price competition among insurers;
Prevent practices that tend to bring about monopoly or destroy competition; and
Encourage the most efficient and economic rating and marketing practices. 
All commercial policies issued in this state must be issued in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

All authorized insurers and rating organizations in this state are required to file with the Commissioner all rates and rate amendments no later than 30 days after they become effective. Policy forms must be filed with the Commissioner at least 30 days before they become effective. All of the filings become public information and are open to public inspection at any time.

Rates cannot be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. When determining insurance rates, several factors need to be taken into consideration. These factors include analyzing past and potential loss experiences, including any conflagration or catastrophe risks within and outside the state. Additionally, all factors relevant to the specific type of insurance being offered should be considered. The rates should also allow for a reasonable profit for the insurer. If the insurer is participating, policyholders' dividends should also be taken into account.

Insurers have the option to set their own rates and supplementary rate information or utilize rates and supplementary rate information provided by a rating organization. If an insurer uses rates provided by a rating organization, the insurer may modify the rates and supplementary rate information based on their own expense and loss experience.

The Commissioner can order that the rates for that particular line of business be submitted to the Department for review and approval. In the case of policy forms, the Commissioner can order that the forms for that particular line of business be submitted to the Department for approval before they can become effective.

If the Commissioner suspects a violation of the Act has occurred, the Commissioner must provide a notice of hearing to the person, partnership, association, corporation, insurer, or rating organization suspected of the violation. If, after the hearing, the Commissioner finds evidence of the violation, the Commissioner may suspend or revoke the guilty party's license and impose a penalty of no less than $25 and no more than $500 for each willful violation of the Act.

Any filing and its supporting information must be made available for public inspection as soon as it is filed. Individuals can request copies of these filings and supporting information by paying a reasonable fee.

The Commissioner is responsible for establishing a designated range of annual rate changes for medical malpractice liability insurance. This range must be between a minimum of 5% and a maximum of 15%. Any rate, supplementary rate information, or changes filed by an insurer or rating organization is within 30 days of the change.

Insurers and rating organizations may only file one rate change (within the designated range) in a 12-month period, without explicit approval of the Commissioner. Rate changes that exceed the designated range must be approved by the Commissioner.

The filing of rates statutes do not apply to special risks.

Special risks include the following:

Commercial lines insurance risks that are unusual in nature, a high loss hazard, difficult to place or rate, excess or umbrella, or eligible for export;
Commercial lines insurance risks that produce a minimum annual premium of over $10,000 (other than medical malpractice liability insurance risks);
Inland marine insurance; or 
Fidelity, surety, or forgery bonds.
Special risks that meet the minimum annual premium can be written under a single policy with a premium over $10,000, written under multiple policies by the same insurer or group, or covered under a single policy that generates an annual premium over $10,000 for multiple risks.

Insurers are required to maintain detailed underwriting files, premium, loss and expense statistics, financial records, and other relevant records related to special risks. The Commissioner has the authority to determine the level of detail required for these records. Additionally, the Commissioner or their designee has the right to examine these records in the state as frequently as deemed necessary by the Commissioner.

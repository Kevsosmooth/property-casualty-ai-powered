Surplus Lines (Homeowners and Commercial Lines)

1. Certificate of Diligent Effort
   Before placing a risk with a surplus lines insurer, the surplus lines broker must have made a diligent effort to place the risk in an admitted insurer.

Diligent effort means a process by which a licensed producer places coverage on behalf of a New Jersey insured with a surplus lines insurer only after the risk has been declined by 3 authorized insurers, each of which is authorized to write the kind of insurance requested and is an insurer that the producer has a good faith reason to believe might consider writing the type of coverage or class of insurance involved.

2. Exportable List
   The Commissioner may declare certain lines or classes of insurance eligible for export if, after a hearing, it is determined that there is no reasonable or adequate market among authorized insurers in the state. This list of lines or classes of insurance is compiled annually and known as the exportable list.

Inland Marine

1. Personal Floaters
   A personal floater refers to an inland marine policy designed to cover movable personal property, wherever it may be located. Personal floaters may be written on an all-risk, open-peril or named-peril form.

The Personal Property floater provides coverage to personal property on an all-risk basis anywhere in the world, as long as the property is not specifically excluded by the policy. Property is usually written on an unscheduled basis. Certain categories of property are subject to special limits.

The Personal Articles floater is used to insure certain types of personal property on a scheduled basis. The types of property that may be covered are usually pre-printed on the form including jewelry, furs, cameras, musical instruments, or fine arts. Other types of property may also be added to the coverage form.

The Personal Effects floater is used to insure personal effects carried or worn by travelers anywhere in the world, but not while the property is at home. Coverage is usually limited to $100 for jewelry, watches and furs, and there is no coverage for vehicles, bicycles, currency or travel tickets.

2. Commercial Floaters
   The commercial inland marine conditions are in addition to the common policy conditions and any conditions applying to a specific coverage form. They are similar to other common conditions already discussed and include the following:

Abandonment;
Appraisal;
Duties of the insured in the event of a loss;
Insurance under 2 or more coverages;
Loss payment;
Other insurance — If there is other insurance covering the same loss, the policy will be considered excess;
Pair, set or parts;
Recovered property (salvage);
Transfer of rights of recovery (subrogation);
Privilege to adjust with the owner — Because inland marine coverages can cover property of others in the insured's care, custody, or control, this condition says that the insurer will settle with the actual owners of the property in the event of a loss;
Reinstatement of limit — Payment of any claim will not reduce the limit of insurance, except in case of a total loss on a scheduled item, in which case, the insurer will cancel the specific coverage and refund any unearned premium for the coverage on that item;
Concealment, misrepresentation or fraud;
Legal action against the insurer;
No benefit to bailee;
Policy period; and
Valuation — This condition states that the insurer will determine the value of an item following a loss based on the lesser of
The actual cash value of the item;
The reasonable costs to restore the property; or
The cost of replacing the property with like kind.
Coverage Forms
A commercial floater refers to an inland marine policy designed to cover movable commercial property, wherever it may be located (worldwide coverage).

Commercial inland marine coverage can be written as either a monoline policy or as part of a commercial package policy (CPP). Forms may be referred to as filed or unfiled. A filed form is a form that may require an insurer to file for rate and form approval. An unfiled form may not require an approved filing to the insurance department in that state. Regulations may vary from state to state.

A different inland marine declaration is used with each of the different types of coverages written. Therefore, more than one inland marine declaration may be attached to a policy depending on the coverages written. Besides the general information concerning the name of the insured, policy period, and endorsements, the commercial inland marine declarations specifically describes the insured property.

Most of the filed forms include a $250 deductible that applies to any one loss. In addition, the filed coverage forms are usually written on an open peril basis. The commercial property causes of loss forms are not applicable to these coverages. The following exclusions are commonly found in these forms:

Governmental action;
Nuclear hazard;
War and military action;
Delay, loss of use, or loss of market;
Dishonest acts by the insured or the insured's employees or representatives;
Voluntarily parting with property by fraudulent trick, scheme or device;
Unauthorized instruction to transfer property;
Neglect of an insured to use all reasonable means to protect and preserve property from further damage or loss;
Loss or damage caused by any of the following, but if loss by a covered cause of loss results, the additional loss will be covered in the following situations:
Weather conditions;
Act or decisions, or the failure to act or decide;
Faulty, inadequate or defective planning, zoning, construction, or workmanship;
Collapse, other than that provided as an additional coverage; or
Wear, tear, inherent device, or gradual deterioration.

\*Only some of the forms listed will be described
Accounts Receivable
The accounts receivable coverage form is one of the most important and popular of the inland marine coverage forms. Unlike most inland marine coverages, coverage is provided for property that is at a fixed location, rather than mobile property. The accounts receivable coverage form is a filed form that provides protection for losses of accounts due from customers that become uncollectible because of a loss to the insured's accounts receivable records.

Coverage is written on an all-risk basis. Additional exclusions (other than those already discussed) include the following:

Alteration, falsification, concealment or destruction of records to conceal a wrongful act;
Bookkeeping, accounting, or billing records; or
Electrical or magnetic injury, disturbance, or erasure.
The following amounts will be deducted from the total amount of accounts receivable:

The amount of the accounts for which there is no loss or damage;
The amount of the accounts that the insured can re-establish or collect;
An amount to allow for probable "bad debts" that the insured is normally unable to collect; and
All unearned interest and service charges.
In addition, another condition requires the insured to store the accounts receivable records in a receptacle described in the declarations when the records are not in use.

Bailee's Customer
Bailee's Customer coverage forms are used to cover losses to customers' property in the care, custody or control of the insured. Each of these coverage forms is unfiled.

Bailee's Customers Policy — This coverage form covers loss to customers' property without regard to the insured's legal liability for the loss. It covers both the bailee's interest and the bailor's.
Furriers Block — This coverage is written for insureds in the fur business and covers merchandise held for sale and customers' property that the insured has temporary custody of for cleaning, repair, or storage.
Cleaners, Dryers, and Laundries — This coverage form provides protection for insureds in the laundry or dry-cleaning business and covers loss or damage to customers' property while in their possession.
Warehouseman's — This coverage form covers customers' property while it is stored at a warehouse, and it is usually written to apply as excess over other valid and collectible insurance of the property owner.
Commercial Articles

The commercial articles form is a filed form that covers the interest of the owners, as opposed to dealers, of commercial cameras, musical instruments, and similar property, including similar property of others in the insured's care, custody, or control. Property not covered includes contraband and property in illegal trade or transportation. As with all inland marine coverage forms, coverage is provided on an all-risk basis. The form includes all of the common exclusions previously discussed.

The coinsurance clause found in this coverage form is slightly different from other coinsurance clauses. It states that all items covered, but not specifically described or listed, must be insured for their total value at the time of loss to avoid a coinsurance penalty. Another condition unique to this coverage form concerns additional acquired property, which is automatically covered for up to 30 days if it is of the same type of property already insured. The insurer will pay up to 25% of the limit of insurance for the similar property, to a maximum of $10,000.

Contractors Equipment Floaters
The contractors equipment floater is an unfiled inland marine coverage form that generates more premium industry-wide than any other commercial inland marine coverage. It is used to insure mobile equipment and contractor's equipment owned, rented, or borrowed by contractors (as opposed to dealers). It provides coverage for the equipment not only while it is located on the job site but also during transportation to and from the job site, or while it is temporarily stored between jobs. Coverage can be written on a named peril or open peril basis.

Additionally (newly) acquired property — This is an addition coverage provided in this form that allows for additional property acquired during the policy period that provides 60 days of coverage (but not beyond the policy period) to property that is similar to the type insured. This coverage extension is usually limited to 25% of the limit of insurance, or $50,000, whichever is less.

The coverage territory for this form is the U.S., its territories and possessions (including Puerto Rico), and Canada. Equipment shipped by air within points in the above is considered in the coverage territory.

Coinsurance may apply and will be referenced on the declarations page.

Electronic Data Processing
Electronic Data Processing coverage has become more important in recent years. Businesses that own, lease, or rent data processing equipment are eligible for coverage. These unfiled forms usually cover the following 4 coverages:

Computer hardware that is specifically scheduled;
Data processing media, including magnetic tapes or paper tapes, punch cards and discs;
Extra expense the insured incurs to continue the business following a loss; and
Business interruption can also be provided to cover loss of income when the business is interrupted because of damage to equipment media.
Equipment Dealers
The stock of mobile equipment and construction equipment dealers, including similar property of others in the insured's care, custody, or control may be insured under the filed equipment dealers coverage form. Property not covered includes the following:

Automobiles, motor trucks, and motorcycles;
Aircraft and watercraft;
Accounts, bills, currency, deeds, money, and notes;
Property during manufacturing;
Property leased, rented, or sold;
Furniture, fixtures and office supplies;
Improvements and betterments;
Machinery, tools, fittings, patterns, or molds; and
Contraband, or property in illegal trade or transportation.
Coverage is provided on an all-risk basis and the following additional exclusions apply:

Water, flood, surface water;
Unexplained disappearance;
Damage caused by processing or work done on the property; and
Artificially generated electrical current.
The following extensions of coverage are included in this coverage form:

Debris removal;
Pollution cleanup and removal; and
Theft damage to buildings.
There are several additional conditions found in this coverage form:

Valuation — This condition replaces the standard inland marine valuation clause and states that the value of unsold property will be determined based on the lesser of the actual cash value of the property, the cost to reasonably restore the property, or the cost of replacing the damaged property with substantially identical property.
The value of sold property not yet delivered will be the net selling price minus discounts and allowances.
The value of property of others will be the lesser of the amount for which the insured is liable, including the cost of labor and materials the insured has added, or the actual cash value of the property, including the cost of labor and material the insured has added.
Coinsurance — Property must be insured to 80% of its replacement cost.
Records and Inventory — Accurate records and inventory must be maintained by the insured for 3 years after the end of the policy period. These records include a detailed inventory of all stock in trade, purchases and sales, and property of others. In addition, a physical inventory of stock is required to be sent to the insurer at least once every 12 months.
Protective Safeguards — If protective safeguards are required by the insurer, this condition says that coverage will be suspended if the insured fails to keep them in working condition or in operation while the business is closed.
Installations Floater
The installations floater is an unfiled form that is often purchased by contractors and covers items such as heating and air-conditioning equipment intended to become a permanent part of the building. Property is covered during transportation to the construction site, while unloading and installing the equipment, and until control has passed to the building owner. Coverage can be provided on either a named peril or open peril basis. Coverage ceases when the work has been completed and is accepted by the ultimate user or owner of the property.

Jewelers Block
The jewelers block coverage form is another filed dealer's form that covers the insured's merchandise held for sale, and similar property of others in the insured's care, custody, or control.

Typically, once the property leaves the premises, there is no further coverage. Specific types of property not covered include the following:

Property sold under a deferred sales arrangement after it leaves the insured's premises;
Property while it is at public or trade exhibitions;
Property exhibited in showcases away from the insured's premises;
Property while being worn by any insured, employee, representative, or member of their family, relatives, or friends (an exception is made for watches being worn for the sole purpose of adjustments);
Property in transit by:
Mail (except registered mail);
Express carriers;
Railroad, waterborne or air carriers; or
Motor carrier;
Contraband, or other property in illegal trade or transportation.
This coverage form offers several optional types of transit coverage, which will cover property in transit if one of the following is shown on the declarations page:

Carriers operating exclusively as a merchant's parcel delivery;
Armored car services;
The passenger parcel or baggage service of railroads, passenger bus lines, waterborne or airborne carriers; or
Registered mail.
One other condition not found in the other coverage forms is titled changes in premises. It states that the policy does not cover property if the risk has been materially increased by changes in the premises unless agreed to in writing by the insurer.

Signs
Limited coverage is provided in the commercial property coverage form for signs, usually limiting coverage to $2,500, for attached outdoor signs. Coverage under the filed signs coverage form includes the insured's signs, including neon, fluorescent, automatic, or mechanical signs, and similar property of others in the insured's care, custody, or control. The form includes a 100% coinsurance requirement.

Valuable Papers and Records
The filed valuable papers and records form is one of the most important and most popular of the commercial inland marine coverages.

Valuable papers and records are defined as inscribed, printed, or written documents, manuscripts or records, abstracts, books, deeds, drawings, films, maps, or mortgages.

The following are not considered valuable papers and records:

Money or securities;
Converted data;
Programs or instructions used in data processing; or
Material on which such data is recorded.
Covered property under this form does not include the following:

Any property not specifically described on the declarations if the property cannot be easily replaced with other property;
Property held as samples or for delivery after sale;
Property in storage away from the described premises; or
Contraband, and other property in illegal trade or transportation.
Property is covered on an all-risk basis, subject to the following additional exclusions:

Errors or omissions by the insured, the insured's employees or representatives (except a carrier for hire); and
Electrical or magnetic injury, disturbance, or erasure.
There is no coinsurance provision found in the valuable papers and records coverage form. However, there is a special condition that requires the insured to keep all valuable papers and records, when not in use, in a receptacle described in the declarations.

Additional Coverages

Property in transit is the oldest form of inland marine coverage. Transportation coverage is available to cover the exposure of the shipper, carrier, or consignee of goods.

Carriers of property may be divided into 3 categories:

Common carriers transport the property of anyone who hires them;
Contract carriers only transport property of others for which they have a written contract; and
Private carriers transport their own property.
In addition to the 3 types of carriers, there are 3 different parties that may have a financial interest in the property being transported:

Shipper — the person or company that is sending the goods;
Consignee — the person or company that will receive the goods; and
Carrier — the company that is transporting the goods.
Both the shipper and the consignee have an ownership interest in the property being shipped, the extent of which is determined by the terms of the sales agreement. The term free on board (F.O.B.) may be used in connection with this coverage.

For example, if the contract is written F.O.B. – Shippers Location, then the shipper owns the property only until it is transferred to the carrier. Once the carrier has possession, the consignee owns the property and will suffer any loss if the property is damaged during shipment. If, on the other hand, the property is shipped F.O.B. – Consignee's Location, then the shipper owns the property until it is delivered to the consignee.

Common Carrier Cargo Liability
The carrier is considered responsible for the safe delivery of property. Common carrier cargo liability covers the carrier's legal liability for damage or loss to property in the insured's care and custody for transportation.

The law recognizes certain instances in which the carrier will not be held responsible for damage or loss. These defenses are as follows:

Acts of God or nature;
Exercise of public authority;
Acts of public enemy;
Negligence of the shipper — If damage is caused by negligence in packing or shipping of items highly susceptible to damage from ordinary handling; or
Inherent vice or nature of the property.
Bills of Lading
A bill of lading is a contract for the transport of goods between the shipper and the carrier. This document specifies the carrier's duties and responsibilities for the property. Common carriers are required to issue a uniform bill of lading to every person (shipper) that it transports goods for. When a regular bill of lading is issued, the carrier will be responsible for the invoice cost of any damaged property, and the shipper does not have to specifically declare a value. However, the carrier may issue a released bill of lading in which the shipper must specifically declare the values of the property being shipped. With the released bill of lading, the shipper is charged a lower fee because the carrier is only liable for damage up to the stated amount.

Legal Liability
The carrier obviously has an interest in the property while in their custody for any legal liability that may be imposed on them for loss or damage to the property during shipment. However, the extent of responsibility for damage to property during transit depends on whether the carrier is a common carrier or a contract carrier.

Common carriers that offer their services to the public at large are legally liable for damage to property they are transporting with exceptions applying to loss caused by the following:

Acts of God (earthquakes, floods, tornadoes);
Acts of public enemy (wars);
Exercise of public authority (confiscated cargo by law enforcement);
Shipper's fault (faulty or negligent packaging); or
Inherent vice (perishable goods).
A common carrier issues a document called a bill of lading evidencing receipt of goods for shipment. To limit its liability, a common carrier will issue a released bill of lading, which limits its liability to a specified maximum dollar amount.

Contract carriers that agree to serve specific clients based upon a prearranged agreement are liable only for damage to cargo when they are negligent.

The standard of care placed on a common carrier is much higher than required of a contract carrier.

Motor Truck Cargo Forms
The unfiled motor truck cargo policy – carriers form is used by common carriers that transport the goods of others for a fee. It is a legal liability coverage that protects the carrier only against liability for damage to the goods. Property of others is covered on an open peril basis.

Property is covered until delivered to the final destination and up to 72 hours at a facility not designated in the declarations. Coverage can be purchased to provide coverage at unspecified terminals.

Private carriers, or owners who ship their goods using their own trucks, are insured on motor truck cargo policy – owners form coverage form. Coverage is written for direct damage to the owner's property. Liability is not a factor in these forms as with the motor truck cargo – carriers form. Coverage is written on an open peril basis. The form only covers goods in or on a vehicle while in transit from where the shipment begins to the final destination.

Transit Coverage Forms
Annual transit — This policy is used by those businesses that ship goods on a regular basis. Coverage can be written for all outgoing shipments, incoming shipments, or both that occur during the policy period.

Trip transit — This policy form is a variation of the annual transit policy and is used to cover a specific shipment or trip. The policy period is for the time the goods leave the shipper until they reach their destination. Coverage for loss or damage to covered goods is provided without regard to the legal liability of the carrier.

Coverage can be written on either a named peril or all-risk basis, but the all-risk coverage can be written only for goods shipped by a common carrier. Continuous coverage can be provided for goods shipped by several different carriers during transportation until they reach their ultimate destination.

Camera and Musical Equipment
Dealers of cameras and musical instruments can use this form to insure their stock, including related equipment and accessories, and to protect customer's property left with them for repair, cleaning or service. Property NOT covered includes all of the following:

Property sold and delivered;
Accounts, bills, currency, deeds, money, evidences of debt, or securities;
Furniture, fixtures and office supplies;
Improvements and betterments;
Machinery, tools, patterns, molds, and models;
Property in the mail (except registered mail or government insured mail); and
Contraband or other property in the course of illegal transportation or trade.
This coverage form includes an extension of coverage for theft damage to buildings. If damage to the insured premises is caused by theft or attempted theft, the policy will pay for the loss or damage, but only if the insured owns the building or is legally liable for the damage. Damage caused by fire or damage to glass, lettering or artwork is not covered.

All risks of direct physical loss are covered, subject to the following additional exclusions:

Earthquake;
Water, flood, etc.;
Theft from an unattended vehicle (unless locked and there is visible signs of forced entry);
Marring, scratching, exposure to light, breakage of tubes, bulbs, lamps and other items made mostly of glass (except lenses);
Unexplained disappearance;
Inventory shortage;
Damage caused by processing or work done on covered property; and
Artificially generated current.
There are several additional conditions found in this coverage form.

Valuation — This condition replaces the standard inland marine valuation clause and states that the value of unsold property will be determined based on the lesser of:
The actual cash value of the property.
The cost to reasonably restore the property.
The cost of replacing the damage property with substantially identical property.
The value of sold property not yet delivered will be the net selling price minus discounts and allowances.
The value of property of others will be the lesser of the amount for which the insured is liable, including the cost of labor and materials the insured has added or the actual cash value of the property, including the cost of labor and material the insured has added.
The value of negatives, positives, or prints will be the cost of unexposed film or developing paper, including labor and material added by the insured during developing.
Coinsurance — Property must be insured to 80% of its replacement cost.
Records and Inventory — Accurate records and inventory must be maintained by the insured for 3 years after the end of the policy period. These records include a detailed inventory of all stock in trade, purchases and sales, and property of others. In addition, a physical inventory of stock is required to be sent to the insurer at least once every 12 months.
Protective Safeguards — If protective safeguards are required by the insurer, this condition says that coverage will be suspended if the insured fails to keep them in working condition or in operation while the business is closed.

Coverage applies until it is delivered to the addressee or returned to the sender.

The Mail Coverage Form is always written on a reporting form basis, with reports due within 30 days after the end of each reporting period shown in the declarations. All-risk coverage is provided, the same as the other Commercial Inland Marine Coverage Forms. However, there are only 3 exclusions contained in the form:

Government action;
Weapons, including atomic weapons, mines and torpedoes; and
War and military action.
This coverage form includes one extension of coverage for errors and oversight. If, due to an error or oversight, the value of any mailing was not properly recorded, the insurer will pay that actual value of the property, up to the limit of insurance, if promptly notified of the error. In addition, if the value in any one shipment exceeds the limit of insurance, the insurer will only be liable for the proportion of the loss that the limit of insurance bears to the actual value.

Inland Marine coverages are either filed or unfiled with state regulatory authorities. Filed coverages have standardized coverage forms. Unfiled Inland Marine classes are those that present a unique exposure to loss and in which standardized forms have not been developed.

The Nationwide Marine Definition is a statement about the types of coverage that may properly be written on Inland Marine and Ocean Marine insurance forms. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) adopted a Nationwide Marine Insurance Definition in 1953, and revised it in 1976. This definition is used principally for classification purposes, rather than as a definition of underwriting powers.

Inland Marine coverage can be written on almost any type of property that is portable. In addition, instruments of transportation and communication, such as bridges, wharves, and docks, are also covered on Inland Marine coverage forms. Personal inland marine policies are often called floaters, since the coverage floats with the insured property, anywhere in the world. Inland Marine should be differentiated from Ocean Marine, which covers property being transported over water. Inland Marine exposures pertain to property located on land.

The Nationwide Marine Definition defines 4 general classes of risks that may be the subject of Inland Marine coverage. These risks are as follows:

Domestic shipments and transportation risks;
Bridges, tunnels, and other instrumentalities of transportation and communication;
Commercial property floater risks; and
Personal property floater risks.

# Part 3: Inland Marine

## Overview
Inland Marine insurance evolved from ocean marine insurance to cover property that is mobile or in transit over land. Despite the name, it has nothing to do with water - it covers movable property, property in transit, and certain specialized equipment.

## Section 1: History and Purpose

### Evolution
- Ocean Marine = goods transported by sea
- Inland Marine = goods transported over land or property that is inherently mobile
- Developed because standard property policies cover property at fixed locations only

### What Makes It "Inland Marine"
The property must have one of these characteristics:
- Property in transit
- Mobile property
- Property essential to transportation/communication
- Bridges, tunnels, other instrumentalities of transportation
- Property held by bailees (someone holding another's property)

## Section 2: Types of Inland Marine Coverage

### Filed vs. Unfiled Forms
- **Filed Forms** - Standard ISO forms filed with state regulators; used for common exposures

# Part 4: Other Property Coverages (Flood and Earthquake)

## Overview
Flood and earthquake are typically EXCLUDED from standard property policies. They require separate, specialized coverage. This part covers the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and earthquake insurance.

# FLOOD INSURANCE

## Section 1: National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)

### What is NFIP?
- Federal program created by Congress in 1968
- Administered by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency)
- Provides flood insurance to property owners in participating communities

### Why Federal?
- Private insurers historically wouldn't offer flood coverage
- Too catastrophic and concentrated risk
- Government stepped in to make coverage available

### Community Participation
- Communities must participate in NFIP
- Must adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
- In exchange, residents can buy flood insurance

## Section 2: NFIP Coverage

### Building Coverage
- Building structure
- Electrical and plumbing systems
- Central air conditioning
- Furnaces, water heaters
- Permanently installed carpeting
- Built-in appliances (dishwashers, stoves)
- Detached garages

### Maximum Limits - Residential
| Coverage | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Building | $250,000 |
| Contents | $100,000 |

### Maximum Limits - Commercial
| Coverage | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Building | $500,000 |
| Contents | $500,000 |

### What's NOT Covered
- Finished basements (limited coverage)
- Currency, precious metals
- Property outside building
- Living expenses (no Additional Living Expense)
- Financial losses from business interruption
- Vehicles
- Land and land values
- Trees, shrubs, plants

### Contents Coverage
- Separate policy from building coverage
- Personal belongings
- Furniture, electronics, clothing
- Portable appliances
- **NOT automatic** - must be purchased separately

## Section 3: Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA)

### Zone Designations
- **Zone A** - High-risk areas, no base flood elevations
- **Zone AE** - High-risk with base flood elevations
- **Zone V** - High-risk coastal areas with wave action
- **Zone VE** - High-risk coastal with base flood elevations
- **Zone X** - Moderate to low risk
- **Zone B, C** - Older designations for moderate/low risk

### Mandatory Purchase Requirement
- Required for federally-backed mortgages in SFHA zones
- Lenders require proof of flood insurance
- Must be maintained throughout loan term

## Section 4: Write Your Own (WYO) Program

### How It Works
- Private insurers sell NFIP policies
- Policies backed by federal government
- Insurers handle administration, claims
- Coverage and rates are STANDARDIZED (same everywhere)

### Important Points
- All WYO policies have same coverage
- Rates set by FEMA, not private insurer
- Claims paid from federal funds

## Section 5: Waiting Periods

### Standard Wait
- **30-day waiting period** from purchase to coverage
- Prevents people from buying only when flood is imminent

### Exceptions
- **No wait** - If purchased at same time as mortgage
- **1-day wait** - If purchased in connection with map revision
- **No wait** - If purchased when lender requires it

## Section 6: Flood Insurance Key Terms

### Base Flood
- Flood with 1% chance of occurring annually
- Also called "100-year flood"
- Used to determine Special Flood Hazard Areas

### Flood
NFIP Definition (all must be met):
1. General and temporary condition
2. Partial or complete inundation of normally dry land
3. From overflow of inland/tidal waters, unusual accumulation of surface water, mudflow
4. **Affects two or more properties** or two or more acres

### Mudflow
- River of liquid mud on surfaces
- Covered by NFIP
- Different from mudslide (earth movement, NOT covered)

## Section 7: NFIP Key Numbers

| Item | Number |
|------|--------|
| Residential Building Max | $250,000 |
| Residential Contents Max | $100,000 |
| Commercial Building Max | $500,000 |
| Commercial Contents Max | $500,000 |
| Standard Waiting Period | 30 days |
| Mortgage-Related Wait | 0 days |
| Map Revision Wait | 1 day |
| 100-Year Flood | 1% annual chance |

# EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE

## Section 8: Earthquake Coverage Basics

### Why Separate?
- Excluded from standard property policies
- Catastrophic, concentrated losses
- Available as endorsement or separate policy

### What It Covers
- Building damage from earthquake
- Personal property damage
- Loss of use/additional living expense
- Fire following earthquake (may be separate)

### What's NOT Covered
- Flood from earthquake (tsunami, dam break)
- Land and land values
- Vehicles
- External masonry veneer (sometimes excluded)

## Section 9: Deductibles

### Percentage Deductible
- Most earthquake policies use percentage deductibles
- Common: 10% to 25% of coverage limit
- Example: $300,000 home with 15% deductible = $45,000 deductible

### Why So High?
- Catastrophic nature of earthquake losses
- Keeps premiums affordable
- Encourages loss prevention

## Section 10: California Earthquake Authority (CEA)

### What is CEA?
- Publicly managed, privately funded
- Created after 1994 Northridge earthquake
- Provides residential earthquake coverage in California

### CEA Coverage
- Dwelling coverage
- Personal property (limited: $5,000 - $200,000)
- Loss of use ($1,500 - $100,000)

### CEA Deductibles
- 5%, 10%, 15%, or 25% options
- Higher deductible = lower premium

## Section 11: Fire Following Earthquake

### Standard Property vs Earthquake
- Standard property DOES cover fire following earthquake
- Earthquake policy covers shake damage
- Important distinction for claims

### Example
Earthquake causes gas line to break, fire destroys house:
- Standard property policy = covers fire damage
- Earthquake policy = covers shake damage that broke gas line

## Section 12: Key Differences - Flood vs Earthquake

| Feature | Flood (NFIP) | Earthquake |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Federal Program | Yes (FEMA) | No |
| Mandatory Purchase | In SFHA with federal mortgage | Never mandatory |
| Waiting Period | 30 days | Varies by insurer |
| Deductible | Dollar amount | Percentage (10-25%) |
| Contents Coverage | Separate policy | Often included |
| Max Limits | $250K/$100K residential | No federal limit |
| Living Expenses | NOT covered | Usually covered |

## Section 13: Exam Trap Alerts

1. **Flood Definition** - Must affect 2+ properties OR 2+ acres. One flooded backyard doesn't qualify!

2. **Mudflow vs Mudslide** - Mudflow = covered by NFIP; Mudslide = earth movement, NOT covered.

3. **30-Day Wait** - Standard flood insurance waiting period. No buying during a storm warning!

4. **Contents Separate** - NFIP contents coverage must be purchased separately from building.

5. **No Living Expenses** - NFIP does NOT cover additional living expenses like homeowners does.

6. **Percentage Deductible** - Earthquake uses percentage, not dollar amount. 15% of $400,000 = $60,000!

7. **Fire Following Earthquake** - Covered by standard property policy, not just earthquake policy.

8. **SFHA Mandatory** - Only mandatory with federal/federally-backed mortgages, not all mortgages.

9. **WYO Same Coverage** - All Write Your Own insurers offer identical NFIP coverage at FEMA-set rates.

10. **Basement Limitations** - NFIP has very limited basement coverage. Finished basements mostly excluded.

11. **Zone V** - Coastal high-risk with wave action. Higher rates than Zone A.

12. **CEA Deductibles** - California earthquake minimum 5% deductible, can go to 25%.

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "An insurable risk must NOT be catastrophic to the insurer. If every policyholder suffers the same loss at once (like a pandemic), the insurer cannot pay all claims. The other three ARE required: accidental, large number of units, and definite/measurable."

            "explanation": "A trampoline without a fence is a PHYSICAL HAZARD - it is a physical condition that increases the probability of loss. Moral hazard requires dishonesty/fraud. Morale hazard requires carelessness specifically because of having insurance. The trampoline is dangerous regardless of insurance."

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "ACV = Replacement Cost minus Depreciation. $25,000 - (40% x $25,000) = $25,000 - $10,000 = $15,000. The insured receives the depreciated value, not the full replacement cost."

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "For PROPERTY insurance, insurable interest must exist at the TIME OF LOSS. After selling the house, John has no financial stake in it, so he cannot collect. The policy does NOT automatically transfer - Maria needs her own coverage. This is different from life insurance, where insurable interest is needed at inception only."

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "MORALE hazard is carelessness or indifference because of having insurance. Not fixing a broken lock is careless, not criminal.

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "Oral binders are just as valid as written binders. A binder provides IMMEDIATE temporary coverage until the policy is issued. The loss is covered as long as the binder was in effect. There is no requirement for written confirmation."

            "explanation": "Application statements are REPRESENTATIONS, which only need to be substantially true (to the best of your knowledge). Forgetting a minor leak years ago is an honest mistake, not intentional concealment. CONCEALMENT requires intentionally hiding a material fact.

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "The Law of Large Numbers states: the larger the group, the more predictable the outcomes. 500 policyholders x 2% loss rate = 10 expected claims. This predictability is why insurers need large pools of similar risks to accurately set premiums."

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "The principle of INDEMNITY means the insured cannot PROFIT from a loss - even with multiple policies. If two policies cover the same loss, they share on a pro-rata basis. The insured still only receives the actual loss amount. Valued policies (like fine arts) ARE an exception where an agreed value is paid regardless of actual loss."

Insurer B: ($50,000/$350,000) x $100,000 = $14,286. Pro-rata is NOT equal (50/50); it is proportional to each policy's share of total coverage."

            "explanation": "A lottery ticket represents SPECULATIVE RISK (potential for gain), which is NOT insurable. Only PURE RISK (loss or no loss) is insurable. Rented homes, a spouse's car, and a business partner's share all represent insurable interests because the insured would suffer financially if they were damaged/lost."

            "options": ["No, because the warranty is about fire alarms and the loss was from theft", "Yes, because any warranty breach can void the entire policy", "No, because warranties only need to be substantially true", "Yes, but only if the insurer can prove the breach contributed to the loss"],
            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "A WARRANTY must be literally and exactly true. A breach of warranty can void the ENTIRE policy, not just claims related to the warranty topic. Even though the loss was theft (not fire), the breached fire alarm warranty could void coverage for any claim. This is why warranties are more dangerous than representations."

            "explanation": "The INSURING AGREEMENT is the insurer's promise - it broadly states what types of losses the insurer agrees to cover. D = Declarations (who/what/when). I = Insuring Agreement (the promise). C = Conditions (obligations). E = Exclusions (what's NOT covered)."

            "explanation": "Insurance is a CONTRACT OF ADHESION - the insurer writes it, the insured has no negotiating power (take it or leave it). Because the insured had no say in the wording, any ambiguity is ALWAYS interpreted in favor of the insured. This is a fundamental legal principle."

ADDITIONAL COVERAGES = Use money from WITHIN the existing policy limit (do not increase total coverage). This is a frequently tested distinction.

            "explanation": "This is tricky - the EXPLOSION itself IS a covered peril under standard property insurance. Equipment Breakdown coverage is needed for mechanical/electrical failures, but a boiler EXPLOSION falls under the explosion peril. The key distinction: equipment BREAKDOWN (mechanical failure) needs the endorsement, but an actual EXPLOSION is covered under the standard causes of loss."

            "explanation": "Equipment Breakdown covers SUDDEN and accidental failures only - NOT gradual deterioration, wear and tear, or maintenance issues.

            "explanation": "Inland marine FLOATERS provide coverage that 'floats' with the item WORLDWIDE. The ring is covered whether it's at home, traveling domestically, or on an international trip. This worldwide coverage is one of the key advantages of scheduling valuable items on a floater."

            "explanation": "The 30-day waiting period has an exception: when flood insurance is required in connection with a NEW MORTGAGE LOAN, coverage can begin immediately. This makes sense - a lender won't close a mortgage without immediate flood coverage. All other situations require the full 30-day wait."

The $100,000 loss minus $75,000 deductible = $25,000 paid by insurer. The insured pays $75,000 out of pocket. This is why earthquake deductibles are so expensive."

            "question": "A property owner applies for FAIR Plan coverage for a building valued at $1,200,000 with $400,000 in contents. What is the maximum coverage available?",
            "options": ["$1,600,000 (full building + contents value)", "$1,500,000 (FAIR Plan maximum for building AND contents combined)", "$1,200,000 (building only, contents excluded)", "$1,000,000 (FAIR Plan maximum)"],
            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "The FAIR Plan maximum is $1,500,000 for BUILDING AND CONTENTS COMBINED. Even though the total value is $1,600,000, the FAIR Plan caps coverage at $1.5M total. The owner would need excess coverage for the remaining $100,000 from the voluntary market if available."

            "question": "An insurer issues a new homeowners policy on March 1st. On April 15th (day 46), the insurer wants to cancel the policy because they've decided to reduce their NJ book of business. Can they cancel?",
            "options": ["No - reducing the book of business is never a valid cancellation reason", "Yes - within the first 60 days, an insurer can cancel for ANY reason", "Only with 30 days written notice and Commissioner approval", "No - only the insured can cancel within the first 60 days"],
            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "During the FIRST 60 DAYS of a new policy, the insurer can cancel for ANY reason. Day 46 is within the 60-day window. After 60 days, cancellation is restricted to specific listed reasons (fraud, nonpayment, substantial increase in risk, etc.). The 60-day any-reason window is an important NJ-specific rule."

            "correct": 2,
            "explanation": "Under NJ commercial deregulation: RATES filed AFTER they become effective, FORMS filed BEFORE they become effective. Memory trick: 'Rates AFTER, Forms BEFORE.' This means insurers can start using new rates immediately but must get form approval first."

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-payment of premium is the ONLY reason that gets the SHORT 10-DAY notice. All other cancellation reasons after the first 60 days require 30 to 120 days notice depending on the reason. The 10-day non-payment notice is significantly shorter because the insured has clearly breached their obligation."
